The festival of Onam is celebrated throughout the state of Kerala. Kerala during Onam is marked by happiness, excitement and enjoyment among all sections of people. Onam is celebrated as an outcome of reasons that have to do with mythology as well as old agrarian practices. If one is to go by the myth, then King Mahabali or Maveli was a generous and virtuous ruler, who had once ruled Kerala. During his rule, the kingdom became so prosperous that devas (gods of the Heaven) felt jealous about this and also for the reason that King Mahabali was an asura - a member of the demon clan - who were the enemies of devas. So, they sent Lord Vishnu in the guise of Vamana (a dwarf) to King Mahabali. As an offering from the generous king, Vamanarequested Mahabali for three feet of land. And at the time of measuring the three feet of land,Vamana grew so huge that he measured all the worlds in two steps. Since he had nowhere else to place his third step, Mahabali asked Vamana to place it on his head. Pleased by his benevolence, Vamana blessed Mahabali before he was sent to the nether world and granted him permission to visit his dear subjects once in a year. This occasion is celebrated by all Keralites as Onam.</p>
<p>Onam is one of the bright celebrations; individuals commend it with joy. The wonder of King Mahabali is depicted in the fest. People clean their houses, decorate it with flowers, and draw Rangoli at the passageway of their homes.

Temples are beautified with flowers, flags, and Rangoli. Traditional Kerala Payasam is also cooked as Prasadam and in the family as well. The best part of the fest is the communal harmony among the people, irrespective of their age, religion, caste, statement of faith, and gender praise.

It is said that When King Mahabali administered over Kerala, it was considered one of Keralaâ€™s great time. The flower decorations are said as the homecoming of King Mahabali. Rangoli at the passageway of the homes represents the greeting of their adored King Mahabali.</p>
